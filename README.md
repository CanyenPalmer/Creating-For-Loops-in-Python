## Introduction 

As a data professional, you may need to use methods that involve repetition. For example, when analyzing customer feedback from surveys, you may need to compare averages across categories. In Python, using iterative statements helps automate this task and makes them more efficient.

In this lab, you will practice writing iterative statements using `for` loops.

# Conclusion

* Iterative statements play a major role in automating repetitive analyses.
* You can use `for` loops to allow you to repeat a process a specified number of times.
* `if`, `elif`, `else`, logical, and comparitive operators can be used together within a `for` loop to specify which values to iterate through.
* Python built in functions are versatile and can be applied within loops, functions, or stand alone.
